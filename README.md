### This project works on a robot planner which can successfully deliver box into desired destination. 

### For the robot, it can only sense boxes, obstacles and surrounding four edges of this warehouse within its sight range,
### after moving for each step, it has to build a map of the warehouse and localize itself in the warehouse. 

### Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM algorithm is used to do this task).

### The robot is interfered by noise for movement and sensing.

### testing suite contains 5 cases of differnt map and box setup.
